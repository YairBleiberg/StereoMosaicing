my solution: I used pyramid blending on each pair of adjacent parts of images (where each image part is part of a single image, taken between two midpoints of image centers)
I had a problem of the images not being powers of 2, so I padded the images, used pyramid blending, then removed the padding.
ufortunately, the pyramid blending results in ugly vertical strips. I've been unable to determine whether or not they should appear.
